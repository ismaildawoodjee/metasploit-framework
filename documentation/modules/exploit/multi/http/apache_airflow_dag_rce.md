## Vulnerable Application

The vulnerability affects:

    * Apache Airflow versions less than 1.10.11

This module was successfully tested on:

    * Apache Airflow 1.10.10 installed with Docker on Debian 10
    * Apache Airflow 1.10.10 installed with Docker on Kali Linux 6.3.0
    * Apache Airflow 1.10.10 installed with Docker on Windows 10

Note that this module has not been tested on non-Docker installations of Airflow.

### Description

This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability by combining
two critical vulnerabilities in Apache Airflow 1.10.10. The first, CVE-2020-11978, is
an authenticated command injection vulnerability found in one of Airflow's example DAGs,
`example_trigger_target_dag`, which allows any authenticated user to run arbitrary OS
commands as the user running Airflow Worker/Scheduler. The second, CVE-2020-13927, is a
default setting of Airflow 1.10.10 that allows unauthenticated access to Airflow's
Experimental REST API to perform malicious actions such as creating the vulnerable DAG
above. The two CVEs taken together allow vulnerable DAG creation and command injection,
leading to unauthenticated remote code execution.

### Setup

Install Apache Airflow v1.10.10 with a `docker-compose.yml` file below
([reference](https://github.com/pberba/CVE-2020-11978/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)):
```yml
version: '3'

services:
  x-airflow-common:
    &airflow-common
    image: apache/airflow:1.10.10
    environment:
      &airflow-common-env
      AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTHENTICATE: 'true'
      AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTH_BACKEND: 'airflow.contrib.auth.backends.password_auth'
      AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES: 'true'
    user: "${AIRFLOW_UID:-50000}:${AIRFLOW_GID:-50000}"
  airflow-webserver:
    <<: *airflow-common
    entrypoint: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "pip install 'apache-airflow[password]==1.10.10' --user && airflow initdb && (airflow webserver & airflow scheduler)"]
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "--fail", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
    restart: always
```

Run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

and wait for the health check logs to indicate a 200 status message, e.g.:

```log
airflow-webserver_1  | 127.0.0.1 - - [11/Aug/2023:11:48:00 +0000] "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 187 "-" "curl/7.64.0"
```

## Verification Steps

- [x] Install Apache Airflow v1.10.10 as described above.
- [x] Verify that the container is in good health by looking at the logs or navigating to
`http://<TARGET_IP>:8080/admin/airflow/login`.
- [x] Start `msfconsole`.
- [x] Do: `use exploit/multi/http/apache_airflow_dag_rce`.
- [x] Do: `set RHOSTS <TARGET_IP>`.
- [x] Do: `set LHOST eth0`.
- [x] Do: `exploit`.

## Options

### TARGETURI (required)

This is the base path of the Airflow webserver. Defaults to `/`.

### RPORT (required)

This is the port of the Airflow webserver. Defaults to `8080`, although Docker port
mappings or custom installations can change it.

### DAG_PATH (required)

This is the path to the vulnerable example DAG `example_trigger_target_dag`, as accessed
from the Airflow Experimental REST API. Defaults to `/api/experimental/dags/example_trigger_target_dag`.

### TIMEOUT (required)

This is the amount of time (in seconds) that the module will wait for the payload to be
executed. Defaults to 120 seconds.
